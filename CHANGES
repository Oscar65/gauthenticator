22/04/2019 Version 0.1
  Fork from google-authentication-libpam developed with GTK+ 3.24.8 in Archlinux to learn to develop GTK+ applications.

  You can create accounts with name and key (max. 16 chars).
  It has GtkWidgets menu, tool bar and status bar.
  Created typedef struct MYDATA to pass several GtkWidgets in signals.

  If you can not get this version, you can try to change the line to check version in configure.ac:

    AM_PATH_GTK_3_0(3.24.8..

  and change the calls in src/gauthenticator,c that return error for previous versions.

  You can add up to 5 accounts with the menu option or the add button in tool bar (only for debug. In final release I can set up to any number).
  Each time a button with the account name will be created. Every time that user press button, the code will appear in the status bar.
  If user press copy button in tool bar, the code will be copied in the clipboard.
  After install you can run the program pressing windows key in gnome and typing gauthenticator.
